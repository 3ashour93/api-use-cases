Confirm Submission
================================

This sample code demonstrates how JotForm's API can be used to modify submission-specific data. 

Sample link is http://www.yourserver.com/confirm.php?id={id} 

{id} tag will automatically be replaced by the actual submission id when the email notifications are fired.

You may also use the [confirmation link generator] (http://www.jotform.com/confirmation-link-generator/) to generate a pre-made confirmation link for your form submissions.
