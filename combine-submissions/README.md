Combine Submissions
================================

*View the [combine-submissions source](https://github.com/jotform/api-use-cases/tree/master/combine-submissions).*

combine-submissions allows you to combine the submissions from your Jotform form submissions into one single .csv file.

You can see it in action [here](http://www.jotform.com/combine-submissions).

This can be useful for combining your data to import it into other applications.  Data can be grouped by form field name or form field type.
